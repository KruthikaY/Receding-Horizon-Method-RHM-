# üè¢ Inventory Control using Receding Horizon Method (RHM) + Monte Carlo 

This repository implements a **Receding Horizon Method (RHM)** for inventory control under uncertain demand conditions. The system models real-world costs such as storage, shortage, and disposal penalties while adaptively choosing order quantities that minimize total cost over a lookahead horizon. Both fixed and adaptive (RHM) policies are simulated using Monte Carlo trials.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File/Folder                 | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/rhm_main.m`            | Core simulation file that implements RHM control logic and compares it to a static baseline. |
| `src/rhm_gridsearch.m`      | Grid search simulation to analyze cost behavior across multiple `H` and `c` horizon values. |
| `plots_and_outputs/`        | Contains all generated plots and result visualizations.                    |
| `README.md`                 | Project overview, structure, and usage guide.                               |

## üí∞ Cost Parameters

| Parameter          | Value | Description                                |
|--------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| `warehouse_cost`   | 5     | Cost per unit of unsold inventory per day  |
| `shortage_penalty` | 20    | Penalty per unit of unmet demand           |
| `disposal_cost`    | 10    | End-of-horizon cost for leftover stock     |

These costs guide the RHM controller to balance between overstocking and shortage penalties, encouraging efficient ordering behavior.

## üìå Key Highlights

- **Receding Horizon Method (RHM)**: Looks ahead `H` steps and selects the optimal order quantity `y‚Çú` that minimizes expected cost over that horizon.
- **Stochastic Demand Handling**: Demand is randomly drawn from a discrete probability distribution for each day.
- **Cost Metrics**:
  - `warehouse_cost` ‚Äì Cost per unit of leftover inventory
  - `shortage_penalty` ‚Äì Cost per unit of unmet demand
  - `disposal_cost` ‚Äì End-of-horizon penalty for leftover stock
- **Static vs Adaptive Comparison**:
  - **Static Policy**: Fixed order quantity `y = 3` used when inventory drops below `r = 1`
  - **RHM Policy**: Dynamically selects best `y` using predicted demand-cost tradeoffs
- **Monte Carlo Trials**: Each simulation run consists of 500 stochastic trials
- **Grid Search**: Evaluates average cost over multiple configurations of:
  - Prediction horizon `H ‚àà {2, 5, 10, 15}`
  - Control horizon `c ‚àà {1, 2, 3}`

## üõ† How to Run

### üîÑ Adaptive RHM Simulation

1. Open the file: `src/rhm_main.m`
2. Configure cost values and simulation parameters if needed.
3. Run the script. It:
   - Compares total cost from RHM and static policy
   - Displays sample dynamic order sequence
   - Plots results and saves them in `plots_and_outputs/`

### üîç Grid Search Across Horizons

1. Open the file: `src/rhm_gridsearch.m`
2. This script simulates all (H, c) combinations and computes average cost for each.
3. Output appears as a table in MATLAB and is saved as a plot image.
